YTFS


A simple chrome-plugin to full screen your YouTube video. Do you have only one monitor? Always wanted to watch videos while working on other projects? Open up YouTube video on a chrome tab, and press on the YTFS plugin icon, it takes you to a new tab which you can resize to any form or shape, for a split-screen view.

Uses basic javascript, and only works with youtube!!
